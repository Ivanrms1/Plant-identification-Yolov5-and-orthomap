#this u can visualize te last result i made in sunday 23/march
In exp u can found all the curves registered in my last train, like call precision curves, and confusuion matrix
validation goes well for this training, but is needed a bit of more data in diferent situations to incremente confidence in object detection, and have a better precision, also in this
same folder i add the imagenesdereferencia folder that has images of inferences, before and after, abd also i included orthomap tiles
